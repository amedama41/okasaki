(* Exercise 6.6 *)
(** (a) snoc rotates r only if the queue is empty, which means the potential is

  * On the one hand, tail may rotate r when the potential is not zero.
  * Therefore, the amortized cost of tail is not O(1) but O(n).
  * For example, when calling 2^(n + 1) snocs, first snoc rotates r and set w
  * to a list with one element, and f has 2^(n) and 2^(n) elements respectively.
  * For this queue, tail creates suspension which rotates r, and snoc force the
  * suspension by making w empty. This cost is 2^n.
  * Reuse same queue, and apply the same operations. Because another snoc
  * creates an other suspension, the cost of another tail is also 2^n.
  *
  * (b) If tail does not create suspension ($ tl (force f)), checkw and check
  * must extract some head elements when forcing f. This cost is not shared cost
  * but unshared cost, so the tail cost is added O(|f|).
  * For example, when there is a queue with n elements in f and 0 elements in r,
  * and calling n tails, nth tail forces f, which cost is n. Reuse the queue
  * which is called n - 1 tail and another tail calling also forces f. Because
  * the operation extracting head elements is not suspension, the another
  * tail's cost is also n.
