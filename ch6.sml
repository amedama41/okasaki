(** Hypothesize D(i) <= min(3i, 2|f| - |r|).
  *
  * snoc repays 1 dept. tail repays 3 dept.
  * snoc decrements 2|f| - |r| by 1. If snoc repays dept for first node for f,
  * the hypothesize holds.
  * tail decrements 3i by 3, and 2|f| - |r| by 2. If tail repays dept for first
  * three nodes, the hypothesize holds.
  * If snoc or tail calls reverse, |f| is m, and |r| is 2m + 1, then ++ create
  * m dept for first m nodes in f, and reverse create 2m dept for node m.
  * Then,
  *     d(i) = 1 (i < m) | 2m (i = m) | 0 (i > m)
  *     D(i) = i + 1 (i < m) | 3m + 1 (i >= m).
  * Because snoc or tail repays dept for at least first node in f, the
  * hypothesize holds.
  *
  *
  * When the invariant condition is |f| >= |r|, 1st, 3rd, 7th, 15th, 31th, 63th
  * snoc and 27 th tail call reverse, so reverse is called 7 times.
  * When the invariant condition is 2|f| >= |r|, 1st, 4th, 13th, 40th snocs and
  * 11th tail call reverse, so reverse is called 5 times.
  * Therefore, the number of reverse calls of the later implementation is less
  * than that of the former. While the average cost of reverse is bigger.
  * The later cost is 100 / 5 = 20, and the former is 100 / 7 = 14.28.

(** The complete cost of findMin is k. findMin does not change the

  * Let n1, k1 be the number of trees, the number of nodes in one heap
